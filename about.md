Hello there. I'm Ben Chatelain and this is my reflog.
You'll find me as [`@phatblat`](https://twitter.com/phatblat) across the interwebs.

## Work

I'm a multiplatform SDK engineer, working for [Ditto](https://ditto.live/) on the SDK team.
I lead development on our Android SDK and contribute to our other SDKs.

### Work Projects

- I created a [swift package](https://github.com/getditto/DittoSwiftPackage) for our Apple SDKs.
- I split out a JVM SDK from our Android SDK, but we decided not to ship it.
- I added initial support for Xamarin.iOS to our .NET SDK.
- I published our [C++ SDK for Android](https://docs.ditto.live/get-started/install-guides/cpp) to Maven Central.
- I added [support for visionOS](https://github.com/getditto/DittoSwiftPackage/releases/tag/4.8.0-experimental-visionos-support) to our Swift SDK.
