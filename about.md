Hello there. I'm Ben Chatelain and this is my reflog.
You'll find me as [`@phatblat`](https://twitter.com/phatblat) on all the things.

## Apple Wallet Pass

## Work

I work for [Kaiser Permanente](http://kp.org) in the Mobility Center of Excellence.
My team maintains a suite of reusable libraries that are used in
many internal and external iOS and Android apps.
We provide an internal DevOps solution called the Mobile Delivery Pipeline,
which includes a custom Gradle plugin (100% Kotlin), a Jenkins Shared Library,
and tailored macOS VM image.
I also consult with various development teams across our company on mobile app
architecture, build and development issues.
