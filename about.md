Hello there. I'm [phatblat](https://twitter.com/phatblat), aka Ben Chatelain, and this is my reflog. You'll find me as `phatblat` on all the things.

By day I write iOS apps for [Kaiser Permanente](http://kp.org). The main project I'm working on now is the [Every Body Walk!](http://everybodywalk.org) app for iPhone and Apple Watch. I have done a lot of work on the flagship Kaiser Permanente app, as well as dozens of internal enterprise apps. I maintain our internal CocoaPods private pod libraries and help out with CI.

By night I contribute to [ObjectiveGit](https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git) and many other open source projects. I've been working on a [git app for iOS](http://octop.ad) for several years now. Who knows if I'll ever release it.

This blog is built using [Octopress 3](http://octopress.org) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) with a custom domain. If you find errors, I'd love it if you could [open an issue](https://github.com/phatblat/reflog/issues/new) or, better yet, just use the [GitHub web editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) to fix it send me a PR.
